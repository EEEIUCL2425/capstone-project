PanCamera(float xAxis, float yAxis)
-Pans the camera given xAxis and yAxis:
  xAxis:
    0 > xAxis >= -1: Left
    0 < xAxis <= 1: Right    
  yAxis:
    0 > yAxis >= -1: Down
    0 < yAxis <= 1: Up
  Example:
    PanCamera(-1, 0) - pans the camera to the left by 1

SpawnObject(GameObject[] Item, int[] Count, int Seed)
-Spawns a Count amount of Item in a random Cartesian coordinate with random rotation. Randomness is defined by Seed.
-The Cartesian coordinate is bounded from (endX1, endZ1) to (endX2, endZ2) (set to the size of the table)
  Example:
    SpawnObject({ChocoChips, ButterCake}, {5, 6}, 40) - spawns 5 Choco Chips and 6 Butter Cakes in random positions with seed of 40.
